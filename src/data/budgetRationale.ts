Panda voted **YES** on the 350M **Net Change Limit**, but believes spending must be contained.

Panda sees IOG as critical to advancing Cardano. Treasury requests should be directed to known teams with proven track records, or to exceptional, well-justified events.

Panda voted **YES** on Catalyst’s budget. Risks, new teams, bets, minor maintenance, open-source funding, and early-stage products should pass through Catalyst.

Regarding **Marketing**, Panda believes maintaining **Top 10 Market Cap** status is *the* marketing priority. Practicing austerity and avoiding waste — especially on influencer hype or similar — is of utmost importance.



**Votes:**
- • Yes on IOG
- • Yes on Catalyst
- • Yes on Midgard
- • Yes on Starstream
- • Yes on select open-source projects and tooling
